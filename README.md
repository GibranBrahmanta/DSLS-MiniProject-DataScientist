A traffic jam level prediction model that based on Machine Learning algorithm especially Time Series and Classification.

## Solution Approach

- By using the historical data of street condition, weather condition (especially rain), and gap between current date and nearest holiday, we could predict the traffic jam condition on a street in a specific timestamp 
- Using the prediction result, we could know how the condition of the traffic jam on a street before itâ€™s being happen
  - So, the preventive approach to reduce the traffic jam could be done
- For this project, Bogor is being used as a city for doing the pilot project before the project is being implemented on many cities
  - By doing that, we could know the impact, advantages, and disadvantages of the project at a lower level
  - So if the project is being implemented on a higher level, the project could create more positive impact
